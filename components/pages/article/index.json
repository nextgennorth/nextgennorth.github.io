Additionally, partnerships with businesses across the region are creating internships and apprenticeships, giving students real-world insights and experience."

          "p": "One notable example is the Aboriginal Employment Program, which offers culturally safe learning environments and mentors who can connect Indigenous students with career paths that respect and reflect their heritage. Such programs are essential for building a workforce that’s as diverse as it is skilled, fostering a new generation of NT leaders who honor their roots while shaping the future."
